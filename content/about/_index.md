I work in technology but enjoy cycling to disconnect from the keyboard and enjoy the outdoors. Bicycles have become another huge interest in my life, and I now try to ride around 10 hours a week. This is a blog about my mullings and learnings about the bicycle and beyond.

In the modern office workspace I believe it is hugely important to try and find a hobby that allows you to disconnect and makes it difficult for you to access your screen whether that is a mobile phone or a Laptop. 

Additionally, as someone that sits down for the majority of the day, I belive it's hugely important to spend at least 30 minutes of your day active.
