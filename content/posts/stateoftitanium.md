Last year, I made the decision that I was to embark on a bikepacking adventure across Spain. For this challenge, I decided it was the perfect excuse to look of buying a versitle bicycle, and settled on buying a bicycle made of Titanium. Titanium offers some benefits over most types of steel in that it does not rust, is light, and therefore offers a comfortable middleground between carbon and steel. This is not always true with the advent of Reynolds 853 and 953, but I wanted to look at buying a bicycle for life. This brought me to the mine field that is the titanium bicycle market.
