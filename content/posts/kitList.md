**The Good**:
Good pairs of bib shorts are absolutely essential for this kind of trip, as you are going to be spending a lot of time in them. I absolutely love the Cargo shorts from Rapha, they have been amazing to wear with a technical t-shirt. I will be buying more of these as they are super versitle shorts. You have pockets in the back as well as on the side of the leg. The rapha Windproof Jacket kept me warm enough even on the descents in Andorra. So far I have seen no rain!

Insulation tape has been immensely useful for patching up my handlebars where they have torn and taping innertubes or rub points on my frame up. 

**The Bad**:
I did absolutely no cooking and was finding it hard to justify carrying a stove and coffee making equipment around. I did end up making overnight oats in a bath tub and at numerous camping points, but it was not worth it. I had the cup that I could make overnight oats in too. This went home. After the pyrenees it was unlikely I would need a Gillet and a Jacket, so the Gillet went home. The minispeaker was a mistake as it was not used whatseover for the first 2 years, earphones are more suitbale! I sent the third Pantani jersey home as I thought it made me look like a bit of a fool and it also has resale value.
