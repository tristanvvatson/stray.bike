My trip through Spain (LINK) took me from the south of France to Seville. I followed the East and then Southern coast. The route took me through major cities, and I couldn't help but look for cities that might be potential destinations to visit in the future with friends and bicycles. Although there are destinations that are very common knowledge throughout the cycling scene, namely Pollenca within Mallorca, Calpe in the Costa Brava and Girona within Spain, I do feel these are at saturation points.

**The Benchmark**: First lets look at a great city for cycling.

**Girona:**
For me this is the benchmark city for a cycling destination for those who want to get away and ride on some beautiful roads with enough varitation to keep you coming back. Girona was little known in the cycling world until Lance Armstrong moved there post Festina Affair in 2000. The doping laws following the infamous scandal 1998 bust were certainly tightened in France, which included Nice where Lance and his US Postal teammates were living at the time. Therefore, the team looked for alternatives. Girona is likely somewhere Lance had visited before, perhaps even for a training camp. His teammates and himself took a plunge and decided that Girona was a good base for training and importantly varied enough for spouses. But the loose doping laws werenÂ´t the only draw of Girona, even at that time when it was still a little rough around the edges, especially in the now coveted Barri Vell which has endured a mighty resurgence since cycling tourism has taken over.

Accessiblility is one of the key benefits of Girona. It has it`s own small airport, Girona Costa Brava, which operates flights from many destinations across Europe under budget airlines such as Ryanair or Jet2. Sadly, at the time of writing, flights stop operating during the off-season from mainland Europe, meaning a lack of flights from April to October. From Girona Costa Brava airport, there is a taxi that can get you into the city centre within 15 minutes. Barcelona Airport, a major international airport, is only 45 minutes away via train. Flights to Barcelona operate all year round, meaning you can still make the journey over when flights to Girona Costa Brava airport are not available.

The climate itself is particularly accomodating for most of the year. Christmas is temperate enough to enjoy a ride to the coast, and March to June you will see more rain but generally compared to typical norhtern Europe it pleasant enough to ride with a gilet and some leg warms at this time of year. The summer months can become unbearably hot, with temperatures especially as high as 40*C in July and August as we continue to see extermes of temperature. This would mean riding early. January and Feburary can bring snow and wet weather down from the Plyrenees, but you still have the options to ride south coast, which are generally less impacted.

The riding itself is extremely varied. Girona is situated on a riverbed within a valley, so it is situated just above sea level. However, the surrounding area is generally mountainous, meaning you will have to climb out of the valley to reach your destination, which is usually one of the local reknowned climbs such as the Rocacorba or Els Angels. There are other climbs that are a little further out from the city, but themselves hold their own as local favourites. Mare de Deu del Mont, Sant Marti Sacalm and Santi Hilari Sacalm are examples of such climbs. Furthermore, theres two coast lines which are reasonably accessible. The coastline south over Sant Grau to Tossa Del Mar has some of the most breathtaking scenery available. Additonally, Banyoles has a stunning lake which is easily accessible and a bit flatter if you want a recovery ride.

The drivers for the most part are respectful and courteous as long as you recipricate and are sensible on the road and allow them to pass when possible. The police rightly see the importance of upholding resident`s concerns within the city centre, and ensure that you are following their strict 1-way system within the Barri Vell area.

There are an abundance of cycling themed cafes and bars within the city such as La Fabrica, which along with The Service Course (which is currently expanding to Manchester and Oslo!) and Espresso Mafia, was begun by former Canadian and Orica Greenedge professional Christian Meier and his wife Amber Meier being by far the largest consortium within the city.

Accomodation can be reasonable out of season, with people understanding about the fact that you have a bicycle and want to keep it next to you whilst you sleep, or at least close by.

More and more joints with cycling connections are also opening for business such as Rocacorba Cafe which started as a quaint foodtruck, or Hors Categorie in which Jumbo Visma and long time Girona resident Robert Gesink has invested into.

Furthermore, there are an abundance of well established bike shops such as BikeBreaks, EatSleepCycle, and The Service Course. All of these shops offer different experiences and bicycle options for all users.

Conclusion: The ugly though, is the that secret is out, and it is potentially coming a bit of a themepark for cycling. I have written in more detail about that here.

**Barcelona:**

Another potentially enticing cycling destination, Barcelona has a hidden opportunity to ride your bike whilst being in a major international tourist hub. There's a huge amount of climbing around the city and a road which takes you all the way to Stignes along stunning coastline. 

Getting there is easy, and you can fly straight into Barcelona (BCN) international airport. Failing that, there are also flights the Reus from where you can get the train. However, the size of Barcelona and the close proximity mean you are probably best just flying straight over to Barcelona Airport. The climate is similar to that of Girona, however you are instead by the coast. This can increase the likelihood of a torrential storm, so be prepared. The riding is extremely varied. You can make use of the city's new bicycle lanes to get out of the hectic city, but be warned that riding within the city centre is a little risky and dangerous just like any major city. Keep your witts about you. You will tend to be on busy industrial roads to get out to the coast, and therefore it is likely best to ride on the weekend or outside or rush hour when these areas are quiet. The drivers are less attentive than in Girona, and more likely to take risks because of the inner city mentality. Mobiles were also a problem here.

Accomodation can be a little expensive too in Barcelona, a city struggling from housing shortages. Airbnb is a big no-no in the city, so expect to be using one of the major websites and write to them in advance telling them of your intention to bring a bicycle. 

There are some great bicycle shops, but if you are heading this way be sure to check out Velodrom, a high-end cycling shop in the north of the city offering top quality cycling apparel and bicycles. There are more bicycle shops to take note of such as the Orbea Concept Store which boasts their full range. Due to it's limited acceptance of being a cycling city though be warned that it could be difficult to rent a bicycle.

Overall, a surprisingly good city to cycle in, but be prepared to spend time getting out of the city, and watch out for the traffic within the major urban zones. Not bad if you want to sneak a few miles in, but not the destination for a long cycling trip.

**Reus (and Tarragona):** Gaudi was born in Reus, and you can still see his house if you visit. Sat at home on my computer, Reus intriuged me as a potential haven for cycling. Where as Tarragona as a city is encompassed with busy roads and motorway junctions, Reus is situated slightly out of this area with a mountaineous area surrounding it. 

Additionally, it has a small airport that supports small domestic flights from major European destonations, but it might be slightly difficult to get to at present. 

The surrounding area of Reus to Prades was one of the quietest cycling days I have ever experienced, not seeing cars for around 2 hours on my way climbing up, but getting to experience incredible views. Cars were a little surprised on my existance on descents however, so take it easy on the way down, as you quickly end up in industrial farmland. Furthermore, there were heaps of gravel sections which I didn't have the audactiy to try, but they certainly looked fun!

Reus remains a Spanish town, and therfore accomodation in the form of flats or hotels seems reasonable. A quick transfer from the hotel also makes this a easy destination for a short stay. I would recommend trying to stay in the busy but authentic town. Like most major towns in this part of Spain, Catalan is the preferred language.

The scene in Reus seems subdued currently, and I was struggling to find any bicycle shops with a good selection or local information. Therefore, renting might be difficult. I recommend that you bring your own if you come to Reus. 

The conclusion is that this sleepy city surrounded by idyllic hills and eerily quiet roads, remains somewhere that I plan to go back to in the future to see what more it has to offer, and seems to be one of the places with the most potential for being a cycling hotspot.

**Valencia:**
Although famously popular with Albert Contador, on paper Valencia looks far too large and urban to offer anything proper in terms of cycling. However, I watched a few early this year from Francis Cade on what it has to offer in terms of cycling. With a large national park on the east side of the city and a reclaimed marsh area to the south-west, it looked intriuging. In the 1950s the city mitigated flooding by diverting a major river. However, at the same time it took the intuitive descision to redevelop the old riverbed by placing a park that now features varied gardens and some beautiful work from Zaha Hadid (LINK). 

The city itself is bussling offering a range of fantastic restaurants and cafes as well as bars and shopping if you are that way inclined. Additionally the beach is just a short journey away which is great if you wanted to relax a little too. 

Flying in is easy and the airport is relatively nearby. It's also a large airport, and offers good connections from major European airports. Getting to the city is either a coach or train journey RESEARCH.

Accomodation is still reasonable in the city with an abundance of hostels or cheap hotels. The hostel I stayed at (Purple Nest Hostel) allowed me to store my bicycle securely, just be sure to always write ahead and inform them of this, as there's nothing worse than seeing a hotel consiarge (SP) stressed out because they're not sure if they're allowed you to let your bicycle in a room. 

Bicycle shops are plentiful and renting is straight forward too RESEARCH. You can easily go out to 

The riding itself is wonderful and boasts a wealth of challenging short but steep climbs. Getting out to the national park from the city is a breath of fresh air with a great cycle network that runs the length of the old riverbed mentioned above, or through the city itself. After you get out, your greeted with smooth tarmac and ever quietening roads. There are lots of cyclists in the area, plus some WT teams (LINK) getting some training in. There was a few surprises, such as the 20% monster (LINK) and a steep sketchy descent that I wish I had come up the other way (LINK). Overall, you can do loops or do up and down peaks in this area, and with the quiet varied roads I can see why this is a hidden popular area for a lot of cyclists.

Overall, I think this is the perfect mix between cycling and city living, and I am looking forward to sneaking my bicycle on the plan for a weekend away at some point in the future.

**Costa Blanca:**
The Costa Blanca is an area that is becoming increasingly popular but is perhaps a guarded secret. Here, temperatures remain high all year long and even in the winter, making it an increasingly popular place for the pofessionals to be summoned for training camps. The main base seems to be Calpe, which has a large migrant population from all over Europe. Here there are famous climbs such as the Col Du Rates

**Granada and Costa Tropical:**
Granada is a beautiful historic city situated in a vast plain north of the Sierra Nevada mountain range.
