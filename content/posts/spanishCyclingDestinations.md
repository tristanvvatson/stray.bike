As the general route took me through major cycling cities along the eastern then southern coast, it was possible for me to look for cities that might be potential destinations to visit in the future with friends and bicycles.

This was particularly important to me, as although there are destinations that are very common knowledge throughout the cycling scene, namely Pollenca within Mallorca and Girona within Spain, I do feel these are at saturation points.

Therefore, I will be documenting the cities that I go to within Spain to look at their general pros and cons in terms of cycling.

**Girona:**
For me this is the benchmark city for a cycling destination for those who want to get away and ride on some beautiful roads with enough varitation to keep you coming back. Girona was little known in the cycling world until Lance Armstrong moved there post Festina Affair in 2000. The doping laws following the infamous scandal 1998 bust were certainly tightened in France, which included Nice where Lance and his US Postal teammates were living at the time. Therefore, he looked for alternatives. Girona is likely somewhere Lance had visited before, perhaps even for a training camp. His teammates and himself took a plunge and decided that Girona was a good base for training and importantly varied enough for spouses. But the loose doping laws werenÂ´t the only draw of Girona, even at that time when it was still a little rough around the edges, especially in the now coveted Barri Vell which has endured a mighty resurgence since cycling tourism has taken over. Girona has many benefits for cyclists wanting to get away and spend some time riding lucious, varied and supciously smooth roads. 
Accessiblility is one of the key benefits of Girona. It has it`s own small airport, Girona Costa Brava, which operates flights from many destinations across Europe under budget airlines such as Ryanair or Jet2. Sadly, at the time of writing, flights stop operating during the off-season from mainland Europe, meaning a lack of flights from April to October. From Girona Costa Brava airport, there is a taxi that can get you into the city centre within 15 minutes. Barcelona Airport, a major international airport, is only 45 minutes away via train. Flights to Barcelona operate all year round, meaning you can still make the journey over when Girona Costa Brava airport is not operating. This means the city is particularly accessible with your bicycle.
The climate itself is particularly accomodating for most of the year. Christmas is temperate enough to enjoy a ride to the coast, and March to June you will see more rain but generally compared to typical norhtern Europe it pleasant enough to ride with a gilet and some leg warms at this time of year. The summer months can become unbearably hot, with temperatures especially as high as 40*C in July and August as we continue to see extermes of temperature. This would mean riding early. January and Feburary can bring snow and wet weather down from the pyrenees, but you still have the options to ride south away to the foothills, which are generally less impacted.
The riding itself is extremely varied. Girona is situated on a riverbed within a valley, so it is situated just above sea level. However, the surrounding area is generally mountainous, meaning you will have to climb out of the valley to reach your destination, which is usually one of the local reknowned climbs such as the Rocacorba or Els Angels. There are other climbs that are a little further out from the city, but themselves hold their own as local favourites. Mare de Deu del Mont, Sant Marti Sacalm and Santi Hilari Sacalm are examples of such climbs. Furthermore, theres two coast lines which are reasonably accessible. The coastline south over Sant Grau to Tossa Del Mar has some of the most breathtaking scenery available. Additonally, Banyoles has a stunning lake which is easily accessible and a bit flatter.
The drivers for the most part are respectful and courteous as long as you recipricate and are sensible on the road. The police rightly see the importance of upholding resident`s concerns within the city centre, and ensure that you are following their 1-way system within the Barri Vell area.
There are an abundance of cycling themed cafes and bars within the city such as La Fabrica, which along with The Service Course and Espresso Mafia, was begun by former Canadian and Orica Greenedge professional Christian Meier and his wife Amber Meier being by far the largest consortium within the city.
Furthermore, there are an abundance of well established bike shops such as BikeBreaks, EatSleepCycle, and The Service Course, which has begun to expand to Manchester and Oslo with some big names from the cycling world as investors. All of these shops offer different experiences and bicycle options for all users.

The ugly though, is the that secret is out, and it is potentially coming a bit of a themepark for cycling. I have written in more detail about that here.
